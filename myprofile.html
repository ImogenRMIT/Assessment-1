<h2 style="color:powderblue;">About Me</h2>
<img src="Profile PhotoC.jpg" style"="width:150px;height:200x;" style="text-align:right;">
<p style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Number: s3667801</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">RMIT Student Email: s3667801@student.rmit.gov.au</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business â€“ Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family & considering the environment.</p>
<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely understand why IT is essential to understanding & learning about business! It is how we communicate, make payments, receive money, advertise, market our businesses.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (& how fundamental it is to an online business). I am keen to understand more & learn through this course, if not to sound less ignorant & to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">RMIT offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, and specifically the financial planning aspect of life & business. Other universities offered similar commerce, accounting, finance, business type degrees, however not one which would provide me with the financial planning angle I was after (& which is recognised by financial planning institution).</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects to go to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far & expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance and wealth creation and management.</p>
<h2 style="color:powderblue;">Ideal Job</h2>
<h4>Business Analyst</h4>

<p style="font-family:courier;">A Business Analyst analyses data and business processes to identify and define existing and potential inefficiencies, then creates, communicates, and implements solutions for these inefficiencies, whilst also ascertaining opportunities to utilise.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business, and improving efficiency and profitability of a business is what I am passionate about.  To strategise and implement change in a local council, bettering the lives of the residents in that municipality (especially an area with lower socio-economic status) would be a passion job for me.</p> 
<p style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in business in senior roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree, (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge of IT (which I would consider reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me.</p>
