  <h2 style="color:powderblue;">About Me</h2>
<img src="Profile PhotoC.jpg" style"="width:150px;height:200x;" style="text-align:right;">
<br>                         
  <p style="font-family:courier;">My name is Imogen Leaver, I am Australian born, of English, Irish and Scottish decent.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I only speak English, however my sister-in-law is half Peruvian, and is determined to teach me Spanish.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a Bachelor of Business – Financial Planning, having gained recognition of prior learning from a Diploma in Business.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I love riding my bike, going to the beach, travelling (on hold thanks to COVID), my family and considering the environment.</p>
<br>
  <h2 style="color:powderblue;">Interest in IT</h2>
<p style="font-family:courier;">This IT unit is a core subject in my business degree, running two business, I completely appreciate why IT is essential to understanding and learning about business. It is the platform on which we communicate, manage eCommerce, accounting, taxation, and advertise and market our business.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently in the process of creating an ecommerce website, it has shown me how ignorant I was about IT (and how fundamental it is to modern business). I am keen to learn more through this course, if not to sound less ignorant, to be more self-sufficient with managing this side of business.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I arrived at RMIT because it offered the specific degree I was after, my key interest is business, specifically the financial planning aspect (of life & business). Other universities offer similar commerce, accounting, finance, and business degrees, however not with the financial planning angle I was after.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I only have 6 subjects left to complete my degree, I have learnt so much thus far and expect to expand my knowledge of financial and accounting compliance, wealth creation and management, and of course IT!</p>

  <h2 style="color:powderblue;">Ideal Job</h2>
<h4 style="font-family:courier;">Business Analyst</h4>
<a href="https://www.seek.com.au/job/50557327?type=standard#searchRequestToken=6f6fc732-f80f-4776-b762-e36b15f5e3cb">Business Analyst Seek Ad</a>
<p style="font-family:courier;">The ideal candidate for this position will have experience analysing data and business processes to identify and define existing and potential inefficiencies, be competent in then creating, communicating, and implementing solutions, whilst ascertaining opportunities to utilise.</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">I am currently completing a business degree, analysing business to improve efficiency and profitability is what I am passionate about.  To strategise and implement change in a local council, bettering the lives of the residents in that municipality (especially an area with lower socio-economic status) would be a passion job for me.</p> 
<p style="font-family:courier;">I have worked in senior business roles for over a decade, I have experience managing teams, liaising with all levels of business support and management, improving business procedures and profitability and as mentioned above, I am currently in the last stages of completing a business degree (majoring in financially planning), which will solidify and streamline my business experience. I certainly could expand my knowledge in IT (which at present is reasonably basic), it is an area where I have previously relied on expert team members and departments to support me. I am hoping this unit in addition to further hands on experience, especially in the technical side of IT will improve my competency and eligibility for employment positions such as this.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:courier;">Myers-Brigs Type Indicator</h4>
<p>“The Protagonist”</p>
<p style="font-family:courier;">Extraverted 	- 	63%</p>

<a href="https://www.16personalities.com/enfj-personality">The Protagonist Personality</a> 
<p style="font-family:courier;">I can see correlations between my personality and that of The Protagonist. It describes Protagonists as positive team players, which I like to think I am. It does state that a Protagonists can overburden themselves by helping others, which I have been guilty of historically. Keeping this in mind when forming a team, I will encourage team members who are ready and equal contributors.</p>

<p style="font-family:courier;">Pragmatist Style</p>

<br>            
<p style="font-family:courier;">I did this learning test twice and gained slightly different results, I would say I sit on the fence between the two learning styles. Theorists are disciplined and like to work through problems in a logical manner, valuing rationality and objectivity, as do I. Pragmatists need to see how something fits into real life, which I find makes a huge difference to my learning. The good news is both these styles lend themselves to university teaching; tutorials, case studies, discussions, practicals etc, so I can feel confident with this learning environment amongst my team members.</p>

<h4 style="font-family:courier;">Big Five Personality Test</h4>
<a href="Big 5 Factors Results Summary.pdf" target="_blank">Big 5 Factors Results Summary</a>
<p style="font-family:courier;">My top rating percentiles were agreeableness, intellect/imagination, and conscientiousness. My friends certainly call me optimistic, I would say I can be impulsive, however I generally plan out my week (I find being busy with a family, you have to). I have travelled all over the world and lived in other countries, so I would consider myself open to experience. Hopefully, these qualities lend themselves flexibly to a group/team environment, being open to experience, I think will assist my attitude towards the task. Planning and optimism are definitely needed when forming a group for an assignment!</p>
